\page bindings Bindings for other languages
## Official Bindings
Nexus's API is written in C. It is recommended to develop addons in C++ due to the ease of integrating [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) in its native language.

## Community Bindings
As further bindings are created and permission is obtained from maintainers, more links to community bindings will fill the table below.
